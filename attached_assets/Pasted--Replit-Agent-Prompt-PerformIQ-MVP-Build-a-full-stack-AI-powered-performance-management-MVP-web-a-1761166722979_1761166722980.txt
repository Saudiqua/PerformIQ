# Replit Agent Prompt: PerformIQ MVP

Build a full-stack AI-powered performance management MVP web application with the following specifications:

## Core Functionality

**Application Name:** PerformIQ MVP

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Database: SQLite (for MVP simplicity)
- AI: OpenAI API for sentiment analysis and insights generation
- Authentication: Simple JWT-based auth (no OAuth integrations for MVP)

## Features to Build

### 1. Authentication System
- Simple login/signup with email and password
- Three user roles: Employee, Manager, Admin
- JWT token-based authentication
- Demo accounts pre-seeded:
  - employee@demo.com (Employee role)
  - manager@demo.com (Manager role)
  - admin@demo.com (Admin role)
  - Password for all: "demo123"

### 2. Data Simulation Layer (Instead of Real Integrations)
Create a data generator that simulates communication data:
- Generate mock "email" and "slack message" data for the past 3 months
- Include fields: sender, recipient, timestamp, subject, message content, sentiment
- Simulate realistic patterns: response times, collaboration networks, volume trends
- Create 20 mock employees across 3 teams with varying performance patterns
- Include some employees with "warning signals" (declining engagement, negative sentiment spikes)

### 3. Employee Self-Improvement Dashboard
**Route:** `/employee/dashboard`

Display:
- **Overview Card:** Personal performance score (0-100) with trend indicator
- **Communication Stats:**
  - Average response time vs team average
  - Messages sent/received this week vs last week
  - Sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative %)
  - Most active collaboration partners (top 5)
- **Performance Metrics Visualization:**
  - Initiative Score (chart showing 3-month trend)
  - Collaboration Index (network graph or simple bar)
  - Responsiveness Rating (gauge chart)
  - Communication Clarity Score
- **AI Insights Section:**
  - "Your Strengths" - 3 bullet points with specific examples
  - "Areas for Growth" - 2-3 actionable suggestions
  - "This Week's Highlight" - One positive pattern identified
- **Weekly Trend Chart:** Line chart showing key metrics over 12 weeks

### 4. Manager Performance Dashboard
**Route:** `/manager/dashboard`

Display:
- **Team Health Overview:**
  - Overall team score with red/yellow/green indicator
  - Number of team members in each performance category
  - Alert count (requires attention)
- **Team Member Cards Grid:**
  - Card for each team member showing:
    - Name, photo, current performance score
    - Trend indicator (up/down/stable)
    - Alert badge if flagged
    - Quick stats: response time, sentiment, activity level
  - Click card to see individual deep dive
- **Alerts Panel:**
  - List of flagged issues with severity and description:
    - "John's communication dropped 40% this week"
    - "Sarah showing burnout signals (late night activity)"
    - "Mike consistently in bottom 20% for responsiveness"
- **Team Analytics:**
  - Collaboration network visualization (simple node graph)
  - Team sentiment trend over time
  - Workload distribution chart

### 5. Individual Deep Dive Page
**Route:** `/manager/employee/:id`

Show detailed employee analysis:
- Full performance profile with all metrics
- 3-month trend charts for each metric
- Recent communication examples (anonymized content snippets)
- AI-generated performance summary (200-300 words)
- Suggested talking points for 1:1 meeting
- Action recommendations (recognize, support, develop)

### 6. AI Analysis Engine (Backend)
Create API endpoints that use OpenAI to:
- Analyze sentiment of message content
- Generate insight summaries from communication patterns
- Create personalized strength/weakness descriptions
- Flag anomalies and performance concerns
- Generate natural language performance summaries

**Key Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/analyze/sentiment` - Analyze message sentiment
- `GET /api/insights/employee/:id` - Get AI insights for employee
- `GET /api/insights/team/:teamId` - Get team-level insights
- `GET /api/alerts/manager/:managerId` - Get alerts for manager's team

### 7. Simple Admin Panel
**Route:** `/admin/settings`

- View all users and their roles
- Configure alert thresholds (slider controls)
- View system-wide analytics
- Data retention settings (mock UI)

## UI/UX Requirements

- **Design System:** Modern, clean interface with Tailwind CSS
- **Color Scheme:** Professional blues and greens with red/yellow/green for alerts
- **Charts:** Use Recharts or Chart.js for data visualizations
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly layout
- **Navigation:** Sidebar with role-based menu items
- **Loading States:** Show skeleton loaders while fetching data
- **Empty States:** Handle cases with no data gracefully

## Data Model (SQLite Schema)

```sql
-- Users table
users: id, email, password_hash, role, name, team_id, manager_id, avatar_url

-- Teams table
teams: id, name, department

-- Communications table
communications: id, sender_id, recipient_id, platform (email/slack), 
                 timestamp, subject, content, sentiment_score

-- Metrics table
metrics: id, user_id, date, initiative_score, collaboration_index, 
         responsiveness_rating, clarity_score

-- Alerts table
alerts: id, user_id, manager_id, type, severity, message, created_at, resolved
```

## Sample Data Requirements

Generate realistic mock data including:
- 20 employees across 3 teams
- 3 managers (each managing 6-7 people)
- 1000+ communication records over 3 months
- Performance patterns that tell stories:
  - 2-3 "high performers" with consistently good metrics
  - 2-3 "struggling employees" with declining trends
  - 1 employee with recent performance drop (alert trigger)
  - 1 employee showing burnout signals
  - Rest are "average performers" with normal variation

## Environment Variables Needed
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_here
DATABASE_URL=./database.sqlite
PORT=3000
```

## Key User Flows to Test

1. **Employee Flow:** Login → View dashboard → See AI insights → Check trends
2. **Manager Flow:** Login → See team health → Click alert → View employee details → Get AI recommendations
3. **Comparison Flow:** Employee sees their metrics vs team averages

## Additional Instructions

- Use proper error handling and validation
- Add loading spinners for AI API calls
- Include sample data seeding script that runs on first launch
- Make the AI insights feel authentic (not generic)
- Add helpful tooltips explaining what each metric means
- Include a "Demo Mode" banner indicating this is simulated data
- Make charts interactive (hover states, tooltips)
- Keep code modular and well-commented

## Nice-to-Have (If Time Permits)

- Export report to PDF functionality
- Dark mode toggle
- Notification system for new alerts
- Search/filter functionality on manager dashboard
- Date range selector for analytics

Build this as a production-ready MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition while acknowledging it uses simulated data instead of real integrations. Focus on making the insights feel valuable and the UI polished.
